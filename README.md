# System-Security-Requirements


# FMJ2 Net Shield

## Introduction

The nature of the work involves completing a partial assessment of the Design World (DW) cloud environment virtual machines (VMs) and developing a hardening plan for their system. The objective is to provide DW's IT team with a roadmap for securing their infrastructure, focusing on patching, updating, and implementing Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) while mitigating high-risk issues on the machines.

## Team Description

Our “FMJ2 Net Shield” team is in Irvine, California. The group consists of the following members:
- Security Engineer
- Network Specialist
- Systems Administrator
- Project Manager

## Company and Network Overview

Design World is a multinational engineering and design firm formed by merging three smaller firms in San Diego, Hong Kong, and Brussels. The company specializes in designing artistic structural support systems, and the CEO of Design World is actively involved in the project. The company operates a private cloud infrastructure in three regions: the US (San Diego), the EU (Brussels), and PRC (Hong Kong). See Figure #1 Below

## Scope of Activity

Our scope of activity includes conducting a security engineering review of the DW system, performing vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, creating a project change request for design changes, developing a hardening security plan, and producing a comprehensive report on the project. We will focus on hardening the VMs, patching, updating, and mitigating high-risk issues. However, training, access control, and monitoring systems are outside the current scope, and we are not doing any exercise, access control, or monitoring.

## Planned Deliverables

1. **System and Security Requirements Report:** A report outlining the security requirements for the DW system based on the security engineering review.
2. **Vulnerability Assessment Plan:** A plan outlining the methodology and approach for conducting vulnerability assessments on the DW system.
3. **Vulnerability Assessment Report:** A report detailing the vulnerability assessment findings on the DW system.
4. **Penetration Test Plan:** A plan outlining the methodology and approach for conducting penetration testing on the DW system.
5. **Penetration Test Report:** A report detailing the findings of the penetration test conducted on the DW system.
6. **Project Change Requests (PCR) and Security Hardening Plan:** PCR for design changes and a plan for implementing approved system hardening measures.
7. **Security Hardening Report:** A report documenting the hardening measures implemented on the DW system and a mitigation plan for outstanding issues and risks.
8. **DW Information System Security Plan:** A comprehensive plan outlining security policies and measures to protect DW's intellectual property rights and satisfy government customer requirements.
9. **Project Report:** A detailed report describing the project's requirements, implementation, testing, and documentation, including lessons learned.
10. **PowerPoint Presentation:** A presentation summarizing the project report and lessons learned.

## Coordinating Access

Regarding provisions for coordinating access or working across country lines, such as conducting scans in China, we will consider the legal and regulatory aspects of cross-border data transfers and cybersecurity. We will also consider local laws to comply with foreign countries. Effective coordination and communication between the parties involved are necessary to avoid conflicts with company work schedules. For example, scheduling access to the systems should be done to minimize disruption to Design World’s regular business operations.

## Emergency Planning

In an emergency, our company has a well-defined plan to ensure the safety and security of its team members, client systems, and data. Here are some key aspects that our penetration testing company may include in its emergency plan:
- **Communication:** Establish clear communication channels and protocols for team members to quickly and effectively communicate during emergencies.
- **Incident Response:** Define an incident response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in an emergency or security breach.
- **Evacuation and Safety Procedures:** Develop evacuation procedures in case of physical emergencies, such as fires, natural disasters, or security threats.
- **Data Protection:** Establish data backup, encryption, and secure storage protocols to protect client data an
